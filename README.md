## 🔬 Featured Research

### 📊 [Multilingual Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06692)
*arXiv | McGill University*  
Investigated bias patterns between French and English sentiment classification using SVM and Naive Bayes models with balanced datasets. **Impact**: Identified systematic biases in cross-lingual sentiment analysis.

### 👁️ [Deep Learning and Eye Tracking for Cognitive State Detection](https://github.com/ethanwongca/Human-AI-Interaction)
*UBC Research Project*  
Developed deep learning models integrated with eye-tracking technology to detect and classify cognitive states in real-time. **Applications**: Human-computer interaction, adaptive learning systems.

### 🤟 [LLM-Enhanced Sign Language Processing](https://github.com/ethanwongca/NLP_Contrastive)
*UBC Research Project*  
Applied large language models to improve sign language inference and understanding. **Focus**: Accessibility technology and inclusive AI design.
